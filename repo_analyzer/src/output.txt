`undefined` in API response because by default it will be set to `image` or set to one of those values `image`, `raw`, `video`, `auto` if specified in upload options, so `resource_type` would be required like `resource_type: \"image\" | \"video\" | \"raw\" | \"auto\"`\r\nI would gladly appreciate any information if I missed something :) have a nice day

`req.files.image.ws.bytesWritten` is no longer available, so, a potential guess solution has been applied by using `req.files.image.size` instead.\r\n- Error observed when uploading a photo via the

When a key value pair is a number only the value is encoded and not the key which leads to unexpected results.\r\n\r\nThe best way to test is with the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { strict: assert } = require('assert')\r\nconst { encode_context: encode } = require('cloudinary/lib/utils')\r\n\r\nconst contextMap = new Map()\r\ncontextMap.set('storeNumber', 100148)\r\ncontextMap.set('vin', '5YJ3E1EA1JF045327')\r\n\r\n// Fails: encoded context is an empty string\r\nassert.equal(encode(contextMap), 'storeNumber=100148|vin=5YJ3E1EA1JF045327')\r\n\r\nconst contextObj = { storeNumber: 100148, vin: '5YJ3E1EA1JF045327' }\r\n\r\n// Fails: encoded context is missing `storeNumber=`\r\nassert.equal(encode(contextObj), 'storeNumber=100148|vin=5YJ3E1EA1JF045327')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe encoding only appears to work if an Object is supplied and all of the key/value pairs are first converted to a String.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime we've had to resort to converting our context argument to a string _before_ passing it to the Cloudinary SDK so we ensure consistency, ex:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nawait cloudinary.uploader.upload(url, {\r\n  async: true,\r\n  context: Object.entries(context).map(val => val.join('=')).join('|')\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Versions and Libraries (fill in the version numbers)\r\nCloudinary_NPM SDK version -

Currently, we can use `cloudinary.picture()` to generate a `picture` tag, but there doesn't seem to be a way to factor DPR into either the `srcset` URLs nor the media query.\r\n\r\n## Describe the problem you’re trying to solve\r\nHigh-resolution screens, such as those on many Apple products, require higher-resolution images to display at full quality than the size in CSS pixels would suggest.  There are (at least) two mechanisms in HTML and CSS to solve this: the `srcset` attribute of `source` (or `img`) tags can specify multiple URLs (each tagged with the pixel density), or you can use the `min-resolution` CSS media query.  I'd like to be able to generate `picture` tags that look like these:\r\n\r\n### srcset example\r\n```html\r\n<picture>\r\n  <source\r\n    media=\"(max-width: 600px)\"\r\n    srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_500/v1/example-image,\r\n            https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/dpr_2,w_500/v1/example-image 2x\">\r\n  <source\r\n    media=\"(max-width: 1500px)\"\r\n    srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_400/v1/example-image,\r\n            https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/dpr_2,w_400/v1/example-image 2x\">\r\n  <source\r\n    srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_500/v1/example-image,\r\n            https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/dpr_2,w_500/v1/example-image 2x\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/v1/example-image\">\r\n</picture>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### media query example\r\n```html\r\n<picture>\r\n  <source\r\n    media=\"(max-width: 600px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx)\"\r\n    srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/dpr_2,w_500/v1/example-image\">\r\n  <source\r\n    media=\"(max-width: 600px)\"\r\n    srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_500/v1/example-image\">\r\n  <source\r\n    media=\"(max-width: 1500px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx)\"\r\n    srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/dpr_2,w_400/v1/example-image\">\r\n  <source\r\n    media=\"(max-width: 1500px)\"\r\n    srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_400/v1/example-image\">\r\n  <source\r\n    media=\"(min-resolution: 2dppx)\"\r\n    srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/dpr_2,w_500/v1/example-image\">\r\n  <source\r\n    srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_500/v1/example-image\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/v1/example-image\">\r\n</picture>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, neither of these are possible to generate using the options to the picture function, invoked like this on my Node backend:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ncloudinary.picture('example-image', {\r\n  fetch_format: 'auto',\r\n  transformation: { quality: 'auto' },\r\n  sources: [\r\n    { max_width: 600, transformation: { width: 500 } },\r\n    { max_width: 1500, transformation: { width: 400 } },\r\n    { transformation: { width: 500 } }\r\n  ]});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Do you have a proposed solution?\r\nI propose we could generate the first one with a new attribute like this:\r\n```javascript\r\ncloudinary.picture('example-image', {\r\n  fetch_format: 'auto',\r\n  transformation: { quality: 'auto' },\r\n  dpr: [1, 2],\r\n  sources: [\r\n    { max_width: 600, transformation: { width: 500 } },\r\n    { max_width: 1500, transformation: { width: 400 } },\r\n    { transformation: { width: 500 } }\r\n  ]});\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr generate the second one with something like this:\r\n```javascript\r\ncloudinary.picture('example-image', {\r\n  fetch_format: 'auto',\r\n  transformation: { quality: 'auto' },\r\n  sources: [\r\n    { max_width: 600, min_resolution: \"2dppx\", transformation: { width: 500, dpr: 2 } },\r\n    { max_width: 600, transformation: { width: 500 } },\r\n    { max_width: 1500, min_resolution: \"2dppx\", transformation: { width: 400, dpr: 2 } },\r\n    { max_width: 1500, transformation: { width: 400 } },\r\n    { transformation: { width: 500 } }\r\n  ]});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second proposal more closely matches the existing interface of the `picture` function, is more flexible, and is probably easier to implement, but it requires repeating the DPR twice in each source specification (once as `min_resolution` and once as `dpr` in the transformation).  In my mind, the entire point of this library is to save us from tedious and error-prone boilerplate, so I don't like having to repeat that.  Thus, I think the first proposal is probably the better choice.\r\n\r\nIs there any plan to implement a solution like this?  If not, would you accept a PR that implements one of these?  Thanks!\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/469/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/421","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/421/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/421/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/421/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/421","id":658604589,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NTg2MDQ1ODk=","number":421,"title":"search

Images are uploaded with missing or entirely omitted context and no error is thrown during the call.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"674\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-06-15 at 5 31 12 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4356436/122131905-86fcc880-cdff-11eb-9ce5-cf03f816f26f.png\">\r\n\r\n## Issue Type (Can be multiple)\r\n[ ] Build - Can’t install or import the SDK\r\n[ ] Babel - Babel errors or cross browser issues\r\n[ ] Performance - Performance issues\r\n[x] Behaviour - Functions aren’t working as expected (Such as generate URL)\r\n[x] Documentation - Inconsistency between the docs and behaviour\r\n[ ] Incorrect Types - For typescript users who are having problems with our d.ts files\r\n[ ] Other (Specify)\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nThe issue appears to be with the `encode_context` function which is used on both `context` and `metadata` options if provided:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/blob/4e3b0f820c3ff99aad6cccd6d3874aca95d25a50/lib/utils/index.js#L566-L571\r\n\r\nIn the case of actually providing a Map, the encode function fails to encode entirely and the result is an empty string. In the case of providing an Object, the encoding fails if any of the key/value pairs are a number. When a key value pair is a number only the value is encoded and not the key which leads to unexpected results.\r\n\r\nThe best way to test is with the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst { strict: assert } = require('assert')\r\nconst { encode_context: encode } = require('cloudinary/lib/utils')\r\n\r\nconst contextMap = new Map()\r\ncontextMap.set('storeNumber', 100148)\r\ncontextMap.set('vin', '5YJ3E1EA1JF045327')\r\n\r\n// Fails: encoded context is an empty string\r\nassert.equal(encode(contextMap), 'storeNumber=100148|vin=5YJ3E1EA1JF045327')\r\n\r\nconst contextObj = { storeNumber: 100148, vin: '5YJ3E1EA1JF045327' }\r\n\r\n// Fails: encoded context is missing `storeNumber=`\r\nassert.equal(encode(contextObj), 'storeNumber=100148|vin=5YJ3E1EA1JF045327')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe encoding only appears to work if an Object is supplied and all of the key/value pairs are first converted to a String.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime we've had to resort to converting our context argument to a string _before_ passing it to the Cloudinary SDK so we ensure consistency, ex:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nawait cloudinary.uploader.upload(url, {\r\n  async: true,\r\n  context: Object.entries(context).map(val => val.join('=')).join('|')\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Versions and Libraries (fill in the version numbers)\r\nCloudinary_NPM SDK version - 1.26.0\r\nNode - 14.16.1\r\nNPM - 6.14.13\r\n","closed_at":null,"comments":0,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/496/comments","created_at":"2021-06-15T22:34:03Z","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/496/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/496","id":921857944,"labels":[],"labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/496/labels{/name}","locked":false,"milestone":null,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5MjE4NTc5NDQ=","number":496,"performed_via_github_app":null,"reactions":{"+1":0,"-1":0,"confused":0,"eyes":0,"heart":0,"hooray":0,"laugh":0,"rocket":0,"total_count":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/496/reactions"},"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm","state":"open","state_reason":null,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/496/timeline","title":"`context` and `metadata` Map support","updated_at":"2021-06-15T22:34:03Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/496","user":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4356436?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ignigena/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ignigena/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ignigena/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ignigena/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/Ignigena","id":4356436,"login":"Ignigena","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNTY0MzY=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ignigena/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ignigena/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ignigena/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ignigena/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ignigena/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ignigena"}},{"active_lock_reason":null,"assignee":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002346?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/igy","id":1002346,"login":"igy","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDIzNDY=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy"},"assignees":[{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1002346?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/igy","id":1002346,"login":"igy","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDIzNDY=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/igy"}],"author_association":"NONE","body":"Feature request for Cloudinary_NPM SDK\r\n\r\n## Explain your use case\r\nI'd like to be able to automatically generate `source` variants based on DPR inside a `picture` tag.  Currently, we can use `cloudinary.picture()` to generate a `picture` tag, but there doesn't seem to be a way to factor DPR into either the `srcset` URLs nor the media query.\r\n\r\n## Describe the problem you’re trying to solve\r\nHigh-resolution screens, such as those on many Apple products, require higher-resolution images to display at full quality than the size in CSS pixels would suggest.  There are (at least) two mechanisms in HTML and CSS to solve this: the `srcset` attribute of `source` (or `img`) tags can specify multiple URLs (each tagged with the pixel density), or you can use the `min-resolution` CSS media query.  I'd like to be able to generate `picture` tags that look like these:\r\n\r\n### srcset example\r\n```html\r\n<picture>\r\n  <source\r\n    media=\"(max-width: 600px)\"\r\n    srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_500/v1/example-image,\r\n            https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/dpr_2,w_500/v1/example-image 2x\">\r\n  <source\r\n    media=\"(max-width: 1500px)\"\r\n    srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_400/v1/example-image,\r\n            https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/dpr_2,w_400/v1/example-image 2x\">\r\n  <source\r\n    srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_500/v1/example-image,\r\n            https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/dpr_2,w_500/v1/example-image 2x\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/v1/example-image\">\r\n</picture>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### media query example\r\n```html\r\n<picture>\r\n  <source\r\n    media=\"(max-width: 600px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx)\"\r\n    srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/dpr_2,w_500/v1/example-image\">\r\n  <source\r\n    media=\"(max-width: 600px)\"\r\n    srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_500/v1/example-image\">\r\n  <source\r\n    media=\"(max-width: 1500px) and (min-resolution: 2dppx)\"\r\n    srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/dpr_2,w_400/v1/example-image\">\r\n  <source\r\n    media=\"(max-width: 1500px)\"\r\n    srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_400/v1/example-image\">\r\n  <source\r\n    media=\"(min-resolution: 2dppx)\"\r\n    srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/dpr_2,w_500/v1/example-image\">\r\n  <source\r\n    srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/w_500/v1/example-image\">\r\n  <img\r\n    src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/mycloud/image/upload/q_auto/f_auto/v1/example-image\">\r\n</picture>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, neither of these are possible to generate using the options to the picture function, invoked like this on my Node backend:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ncloudinary.picture('example-image', {\r\n  fetch_format: 'auto',\r\n  transformation: { quality: 'auto' },\r\n  sources: [\r\n    { max_width: 600, transformation: { width: 500 } },\r\n    { max_width: 1500, transformation: { width: 400 } },\r\n    { transformation: { width: 500 } }\r\n  ]});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Do you have a proposed solution?\r\nI propose we could generate the first one with a new attribute like this:\r\n```javascript\r\ncloudinary.picture('example-image', {\r\n  fetch_format: 'auto',\r\n  transformation: { quality: 'auto' },\r\n  dpr: [1, 2],\r\n  sources: [\r\n    { max_width: 600, transformation: { width: 500 } },\r\n    { max_width: 1500, transformation: { width: 400 } },\r\n    { transformation: { width: 500 } }\r\n  ]});\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr generate the second one with something like this:\r\n```javascript\r\ncloudinary.picture('example-image', {\r\n  fetch_format: 'auto',\r\n  transformation: { quality: 'auto' },\r\n  sources: [\r\n    { max_width: 600, min_resolution: \"2dppx\", transformation: { width: 500, dpr: 2 } },\r\n    { max_width: 600, transformation: { width: 500 } },\r\n    { max_width: 1500, min_resolution: \"2dppx\", transformation: { width: 400, dpr: 2 } },\r\n    { max_width: 1500, transformation: { width: 400 } },\r\n    { transformation: { width: 500 } }\r\n  ]});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second proposal more closely matches the existing interface of the `picture` function, is more flexible, and is probably easier to implement, but it requires repeating the DPR twice in each source specification (once as `min_resolution` and once as `dpr` in the transformation).  In my mind, the entire point of this library is to save us from tedious and error-prone boilerplate, so I don't like having to repeat that.  Thus, I think the first proposal is probably the better choice.\r\n\r\nIs there any plan to implement a solution like this?  If not, would you accept a PR that implements one of these?  Thanks!\r\n\r\n","closed_at":null,"comments":5,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/469/comments","created_at":"2021-01-18T23:25:41Z","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/469/events","html_url":"https://github.com/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/469","id":788600230,"labels":[],"labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/469/labels{/name}","locked":false,"milestone":null,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3ODg2MDAyMzA=","number":469,"performed_via_github_app":null,"reactions":{"+1":0,"-1":0,"confused":0,"eyes":0,"heart":0,"hooray":0,"laugh":0,"rocket":0,"total_count":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/469/reactions"},"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm","state":"open","state_reason":null,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/cloudinary/cloudinary_npm/issues/469/timeline","title":"Device

Description:\r\nIn my project, there are functions related to redirection using Express's redirect, but when I use the `npm run dev` command to start my project, the following related errors will appear:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nerror   TypeError: Cannot read property 'get' of undefined\r\n    at ServerResponse.redirect (/project/console/common/temp/node_modules/.pnpm/express@4.18.2/node_modules/express/lib/response.js:953:35)\r\n    at RenderMiddlewareCreator.middleware

   at runMicrotasks (<anonymous>)\r\n    at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:93:5)\r\nThe script failed with exit code 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I found the corresponding file `/project/console/common/temp/node_modules/.pnpm/express@4.18.2/node_modules/express/lib/response.js`, and respectively in `redirect` and `location` Add corresponding printing operations to the two functions.\r\n```js\r\n// line: 936\r\nres. redirect = function redirect(url) {\r\n   var address = url;\r\n   var body;\r\n   var status = 302;\r\n   console.log('redirect URL:', url);\r\n   // allow status / url\r\n   if (arguments. length === 2) {\r\n     if (typeof arguments[0] === 'number') {\r\n       status = arguments[0];\r\n       address = arguments[1];\r\n     } else {\r\n       deprecate('res. redirect(url, status): Use res. redirect(status, url) instead');\r\n       status = arguments[1];\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   // Set location header\r\n   address = this. location(address). get('Location');\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// line 906\r\nres. location = function location(url) {\r\n   var loc = url;\r\n\r\n   // \"back\" is an alias for the referrer\r\n   if (url === 'back') {\r\n     loc = this.req.get('Referrer') || '/';\r\n   }\r\n   console.log('Loaction Will Set Value', encodeUrl(loc), loc)\r\n   // set location\r\n   return this.set('Location', encodeUrl(loc));\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I get a print like this:\r\n```\r\nApp running at:\r\n\r\n   > Local: http://localhost:8080/las\r\n   > Network: http://10.37.19.122:8080/las\r\n\r\nredirect

ServerResponse.redirect \r\n```\r\nIt can be seen from the code that the corresponding `location` should have a value, but it does not.\r\nBut in this case, when I manually enter the Url that needs to be redirected into the browser, everything returns to normal.\r\nIs it possible to modify the corresponding code obtained by `location` to\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77950278/222633631-4fb88603-c57b-48f0-85a6-143ed8667603.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  // Set location header\r\n   address =

Redirection 3xx](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#section-15.4), states that the user agent behavior when the `Location` header field is set with status code 3xx is \"the user agent MAY automatically redirect its request to the URI\".\r\nNote that it is **MAY**.\r\n\r\nAnd in fact, depending on the user's environment, automatic redirection may not occur and the contents of the response body may be displayed on the screen.\r\nIn the old days, there was an option to disable redirects in Presto Opera's advanced settings.\r\nEven now, when Android Firefox redirects to an app-linked URL with 3xx, the app is automatically launched, but the browser screen still displays the 3xx response body.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it would be desirable to set the `DOCTYPE` and `<title>` element even for 3xx screens.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Improvement plan\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/8368dc178af16b91b576c4c1d135f701a0007e5d/lib/response.js#L963\r\n\r\n↓\r\n```javascript\r\nbody = '<!DOCTYPE html><title>' + statuses.message[status] + '</title><p>' + statuses.message[status] + '. Redirecting to <a href=\"' + u + '\">' + u + '</a></p>'\r\n```\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/5058/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/5058/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/5029","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/5029/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/5029/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/5029/events","html_url":"https://github.com/expressjs/express/issues/5029","id":1423279196,"node_id":"I_kwDOAAOeZ85U1YRc","number":5029,"title":"Would love a README update for non-linear architecture examples","user":{"login":"dylanh724","id":8840024,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg4NDAwMjQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8840024?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanh724","html_url":"https://github.com/dylanh724","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanh724/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanh724/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanh724/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanh724/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanh724/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanh724/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanh724/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanh724/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dylanh724/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":55442612,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw1NTQ0MjYxMg==","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/labels/docs","name":"docs","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":null},{"id":133578712,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMzM1Nzg3MTI=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/labels/question","name":"question","color":"cc317c","default":true,"description":null}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2022-10-26T00:52:52Z","updated_at":"2022-10-30T00:51:26Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"The examples show a linear setup, but no one does this -- which is great for quickstart, but real apis always use /v1/foo1/foo2/\r\n\r\nWhat is the \"recommended\" way to have a nested hierarchy with /v1/index.js, /v1/foo/index.js, for example?

Description:\r\nIn my project, there are functions related to redirection using Express's redirect, but when I use the `npm run dev` command to start my project, the following related errors will appear:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nerror   TypeError: Cannot read property 'get' of undefined\r\n    at ServerResponse.redirect

   at runMicrotasks (<anonymous>)\r\n    at processTicksAndRejections (internal/process/task_queues.js:93:5)\r\nThe script failed with exit code 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I found the corresponding file `/project/console/common/temp/node_modules/.pnpm/express@4.18.2/node_modules/express/lib/response.js`, and respectively in `redirect` and `location` Add corresponding printing operations to the two functions.\r\n```js\r\n// line: 936\r\nres. redirect = function redirect(url) {\r\n   var address = url;\r\n   var body;\r\n   var status = 302;\r\n   console.log('redirect URL:', url);\r\n   // allow status / url\r\n   if (arguments. length === 2) {\r\n     if (typeof arguments[0] === 'number') {\r\n       status = arguments[0];\r\n       address = arguments[1];\r\n     } else {\r\n       deprecate('res. redirect(url, status): Use res. redirect(status, url) instead');\r\n       status = arguments[1];\r\n     }\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   // Set location header\r\n   address = this. location(address). get('Location');\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// line 906\r\nres. location = function location(url) {\r\n   var loc = url;\r\n\r\n   // \"back\" is an alias for the referrer\r\n   if (url === 'back') {\r\n     loc = this.req.get('Referrer') || '/';\r\n   }\r\n   console.log('Loaction Will Set Value', encodeUrl(loc), loc)\r\n   // set location\r\n   return this.set('Location', encodeUrl(loc));\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I get a print like this:\r\n```\r\nApp running at:\r\n\r\n   > Local: http://localhost:8080/las\r\n   > Network: http://10.37.19.122:8080/las\r\n\r\nredirect

ServerResponse.redirect \r\n```\r\nIt can be seen from the code that the corresponding `location` should have a value, but it does not.\r\nBut in this case, when I manually enter the Url that needs to be redirected into the browser, everything returns to normal.\r\nIs it possible to modify the corresponding code obtained by `location`

Redirection 3xx](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#section-15.4), states that the user agent behavior when the `Location` header field is set with status code 3xx is \"the user agent MAY automatically redirect its request to the URI\".\r\nNote that it is **MAY**.\r\n\r\nAnd in fact, depending on the user's environment, automatic redirection may not occur and the contents of the response body may be displayed on the screen.\r\nIn the old days, there was an option to disable redirects in Presto Opera's advanced settings.\r\nEven now, when Android Firefox redirects to an app-linked URL with 3xx, the app is automatically launched, but the browser screen still displays the 3xx response body.\r\n\r\nTherefore, it would be desirable to set the `DOCTYPE` and `<title>` element even for 3xx screens.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Improvement plan\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/8368dc178af16b91b576c4c1d135f701a0007e5d/lib/response.js#L963\r\n\r\n↓\r\n```javascript\r\nbody = '<!DOCTYPE html><title>' + statuses.message[status] + '</title><p>' + statuses.message[status] + '.

(req, res) => {\r\n  res.send(blob) // or:\r\n  res.download(blob, 'name.html')\r\n  res.download(file) // name taken from file instead\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoing this would take care of \r\n1. Setting the response header `content-type` to the blob's type\r\n2. Setting the response header `content-length` to the blob's size\r\n3. and pipe the data from `blob.stream()` to the response\r\n4. if you used `res.download(blob)` then it would also add content-disposition attachment header\r\n\r\nit's also looking like if node will at some point add a way of getting blobs from the filesystem also, but i don't know when.\r\nref: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/39015","closed_at":null,"comments":3,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/4807/comments","created_at":"2022-02-04T12:17:45Z","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/4807/events","html_url":"https://github.com/expressjs/express/issues/4807","id":1124140542,"labels":[{"color":"d7e102","default":false,"description":null,"id":163600,"name":"ideas","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjM2MDA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/labels/ideas"}],"labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/4807/labels{/name}","locked":false,"milestone":null,"node_id":"I_kwDOAAOeZ85DAQX-","number":4807,"performed_via_github_app":null,"reactions":{"+1":10,"-1":0,"confused":0,"eyes":0,"heart":0,"hooray":0,"laugh":0,"rocket":0,"total_count":10,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/4807/reactions"},"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express","state":"open","state_reason":null,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/4807/timeline","title":"[suggestion] send/respond with blob","updated_at":"2022-11-07T05:35:05Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/expressjs/express/issues/4807","user":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1148376?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmywarting/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmywarting/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmywarting/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmywarting/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/jimmywarting","id":1148376,"login":"jimmywarting","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDgzNzY=","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmywarting/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmywarting/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmywarting/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmywarting/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmywarting/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jimmywarting"}},{"active_lock_reason":null,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"author_association":"NONE","body":"It's getting incredibly late here, but I mocked up a quick example that demonstrates how to use `express` via an ESM module.

Imho, as an example, it's a bit easier to add middleware. There's a lot of ease, too, when using `async`. \r\n\r\nHowever, `express@^5` is required.

if TypeScript issues should be opened somewhere else, like at DefinitelyTyped.  Happy to open one there if that's the right thing.)\r\n\r\nThe TS types for `flow` and `compose` from `@types/lodash` permit invalid compositions.   Here's a minimal example with `flow`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport flow from 'lodash/fp/flow'\r\n​\r\ndeclare const f1: (n: number) => string\r\ndeclare const f2: (n: string) => boolean\r\n​\r\n// Ok, good\r\nconst g1 = flow(f1, f2)\r\n​\r\n// This should be a type error! f1 is not composable with f1\r\nconst g2 = flow(f1, f1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[TypeScript Playground link to the above example](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBAcgDYQCYEMDOALBcD0+cAcgKamoVwwRwBm0AxqXACoDKcYS6AngOZQIAVwB2qarWCjMMdEiRwUGHADo22FqNIAPeEmkt5EbXGCZRCeJmF06wRsFKiYAKFCRY9FAHd6QkERlLGx8OjAw3wRXV0pGHigWRhNZegBGAC44AApRLNFhEAAjUigASjgAXgA+OFkoaX5Y0nj0RLhkmXg6ACYs3Kz6xoqauCKICCRSdFEYwjgAeQBrABo4fgnUV07U-jSq7wgfbLo0td6yuaJWbHM67BEkCRK4dGpeMBZSoSgAQnSzJg4KIIPBkuAIJh0EUpnAfMAYNh0tsUvB+D0DnRfCczulLkA)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`flow(f1, f1)` should be a type error, since `(number) => string` isn't composable with `(number) => string`.  `compose(f1, f1)` similarly isn't a type error.  This allows invalid compositions that will likely fail at runtime.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n`flow(f1, f1)` is not a type error.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt looks like the the current types don't error because of the [catchall overload](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/lodash/fp.d.ts#L1327).  When none of the strongly typed overloads match, TS uses the catchall, which accepts any argument list of functions.\r\n\r\nMy colleagues and I started using lodash/fp on a new TypeScript project where function composition is an important part of our toolbox.  This issue is a blocker for our using lodash.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm hoping for a solution, I also understand it may not be possible.  In that case I'm just hoping to learn about why the current types are what they are.  I figure there might be some history and backward compatibility concerns that drove the current types.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpdate: added TS Playground

@jdalton, in #5545 you've stated that lodash has perhaps slowed down in development and might not be updated in lieu of a fresh approach or new project. \r\n\r\nI've also looked at closed PRs and it seems that there hasn't been too much PR activity in recent times, which is understandable in light of shifting gears.\r\n\r\nWith all of the above in mind, do you expect that lodash will continue to get patches for vulnerability CVEs, or is that less likely now ? We're using lodash in a government-regulated environment where one of its recently-detected critical-rated vulnerabilities must be mitigated in 30 days, so we're investigating whether patches are likely or if we should quickly move to an alternative.\r\n\r\nThanks","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lodash/lodash/issues/5584/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lodash/lodash/issues/5584/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lodash/lodash/issues/5583","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lodash/lodash","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lodash/lodash/issues/5583/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lodash/lodash/issues/5583/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/lodash/lodash/issues/5583/events","html_url":"https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/5583","id":1528761876,"node_id":"I_kwDOADxbv85bHw4U","number":5583,"title":"Ignore

if TypeScript issues should be opened somewhere else, like at DefinitelyTyped.  Happy to open one there if that's the right thing.)\r\n\r\nThe TS types for `flow` and `compose` from `@types/lodash` permit invalid compositions.   Here's a minimal example with `flow`:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nimport flow from 'lodash/fp/flow'\r\n​\r\ndeclare const f1: (n: number) => string\r\ndeclare const f2: (n: string) => boolean\r\n​\r\n// Ok, good\r\nconst g1 = flow(f1, f2)\r\n​\r\n// This should be a type error! f1 is not composable with f1\r\nconst g2 = flow(f1, f1)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[TypeScript Playground link to the above example](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/JYWwDg9gTgLgBAcgDYQCYEMDOALBcD0+cAcgKamoVwwRwBm0AxqXACoDKcYS6AngOZQIAVwB2qarWCjMMdEiRwUGHADo22FqNIAPeEmkt5EbXGCZRCeJmF06wRsFKiYAKFCRY9FAHd6QkERlLGx8OjAw3wRXV0pGHigWRhNZegBGAC44AApRLNFhEAAjUigASjgAXgA+OFkoaX5Y0nj0RLhkmXg6ACYs3Kz6xoqauCKICCRSdFEYwjgAeQBrABo4fgnUV07U-jSq7wgfbLo0td6yuaJWbHM67BEkCRK4dGpeMBZSoSgAQnSzJg4KIIPBkuAIJh0EUpnAfMAYNh0tsUvB+D0DnRfCczulLkA)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`flow(f1, f1)` should be a type error, since `(number) => string` isn't composable with `(number) => string`.  `compose(f1, f1)` similarly isn't a type error.  This allows invalid compositions that will likely fail at runtime.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n`flow(f1, f1)` is not a type error.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt looks like the the current types don't error because of the [catchall overload](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/lodash/fp.d.ts#L1327).  When none of the strongly typed overloads match, TS uses the catchall, which accepts any argument list of functions.\r\n\r\nMy colleagues and I started using lodash/fp on a new TypeScript project where function composition is an important part of our toolbox.  This issue is a blocker for our using lodash.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm hoping for a solution, I also understand it may not be possible.  In that case I'm just hoping to learn about why the current types are what they are.  I figure there might be some history and backward compatibility concerns that drove the current types.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUpdate: added TS Playground

@jdalton, in #5545 you've stated that lodash has perhaps slowed down in development and might not be updated in lieu of a fresh approach or new project. \r\n\r\nI've also looked at closed PRs and it seems that there hasn't been too much PR activity in recent times, which is understandable in light of shifting gears.\r\n\r\nWith all of the above in mind, do you expect that lodash will continue to get patches for vulnerability CVEs, or is that less likely now ? We're using lodash in a government-regulated environment where one of its recently-detected critical-rated vulnerabilities must be mitigated in 30 days, so we're investigating whether patches are likely or if we should quickly move to an

My project relies on echarts@^4.2.1, and uses gulp to run browserify to generate the bundle and finally compress it through gulp-uglify. In most cases this process will produce the same files on different platforms (at least in my current project).\r\n\r\n[browserify-gulp-example.zip](https://github.com/browserify/browserify/files/8331497/browserify-gulp-example.zip)\r\n\r\nThe output is the same on Ubuntu and macOS, but not on Windows. The difference is only some digital labels (causing inconsistent order of modules):\r\n![ScreenShot 2022-03-23 171347](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15362491/159664542-fb5a36d3-176a-4a83-9003-fca2ebb948d9.png)\r\n\r\nFrom what I've tried, `echarts/lib/component/axis/AxisView` is causing this inconsistency. However, if I add `bundle.require('echarts/lib/component/axis/AxisView');` after line 10 of `gulpfile.js`, the output becomes consistent.\r\n\r\nBelow is the content of `gulpfile.js`. All files are available in zip archives.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst gulp = require('gulp');\r\nconst browserify = require('browserify');\r\nconst source = require('vinyl-source-stream');\r\nconst uglify = require('gulp-uglify');\r\nconst rev = require('gulp-rev');\r\n\r\nfunction buildMain() {\r\n    let bundle = browserify({\r\n        entries: './main.js',\r\n    });\r\n    // uncomment next line the output will be consistent.\r\n    // bundle.require('echarts/lib/component/axis/AxisView');\r\n    return bundle.bundle()\r\n        .pipe(source('main.js'))\r\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('./bundle'));\r\n}\r\n\r\ngulp.task('build', gulp.series(buildMain, (done) => {\r\n    return gulp.src(`./bundle/*.js`)\r\n        .pipe(uglify())\r\n        .pipe(rev())\r\n        .pipe(gulp.dest(`./dist/scripts`))\r\n        .pipe(rev.manifest())\r\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('./bundle'));\r\n}));\r\n```\r\n\r\n`main.js` has only one line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrequire('echarts/lib/component/axis/AxisView');\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment:\r\n* Node version: 16.14.2 on all platforms, installed via nvm and nvm-windows.\r\n* OS version: Windows

Additionally, without this, it seems there's no way to cache (or load from a virtual file system) the package.json files `resolve` is loading when resolving dependencies.\r\n\r\nIs there something

is relevant for the \"browser-pack\" module, and specifically the prelude wrapper. \r\nThe issue/decision to make is probably just where the best place to implement this in the browserify settings and then match that in browser-pack? With a very small additional option to configure to browser-pack's prelude, browserify can easily easily support this:\r\n```html\r\n<script src=\"main.js\" type=\"module\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nall we'd have to do is conditionally wrap the original browser-pack prelude with an export default iife. it works no problem, I've tested locally. The benefit of this might not seem apparent, but its actually a huge win for multi frame apps. When you import stuff as a module(in chrome at least), it will share the instance of the import across frames, similar to built in objects like Array. This can reduce the memory impact of multiple iframes using the same libraries from MBs to KBs.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify/issues/2004/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify/issues/2004/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify/issues/2003","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify/issues/2003/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify/issues/2003/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify/issues/2003/events","html_url":"https://github.com/browserify/browserify/issues/2003","id":843811805,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4NDM4MTE4MDU=","number":2003,"title":"significant bundle performance increase [replace detective with regexp in module-deps]","user":{"login":"jeremy-coleman","id":25135855,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1MTM1ODU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25135855?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-coleman","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremy-coleman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-coleman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-coleman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-coleman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-coleman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-coleman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-coleman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-coleman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-coleman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremy-coleman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":11,"created_at":"2021-03-29T21:08:16Z","updated_at":"2021-04-03T07:48:20Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"this code can replace the use of detective in module-deps. idk what version of node has support for set and string.matchAll but both can be polyfilled. Either way, this is significantly faster than parsing deps with acorn via detective. It also mostly removes the need for acorn all-together. The only remaining use of acorn/ast stuff that browserify does is from the use of the package 'syntax-error', which is actually an unnecessary dependency imo, and better handled via a transform. The speed increase is significant. For example, a simple three.js scene gets bundled 2x faster using this than esbuild in dev mode.

strings.\r\nThanks!","closed_at":null,"comments":1,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify/issues/2040/comments","created_at":"2022-04-19T01:05:05Z","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify/issues/2040/events","html_url":"https://github.com/browserify/browserify/issues/2040","id":1207598324,"labels":[],"labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify/issues/2040/labels{/name}","locked":false,"milestone":null,"node_id":"I_kwDOAA40385H-nz0","number":2040,"performed_via_github_app":null,"reactions":{"+1":0,"-1":0,"confused":0,"eyes":0,"heart":0,"hooray":0,"laugh":0,"rocket":0,"total_count":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify/issues/2040/reactions"},"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify","state":"open","state_reason":null,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify/issues/2040/timeline","title":"Using

there, I'm trying to bundle same code on windows and ubuntu, and use gulp-uglify to compress the output files. Most of the output files are identical (with the same checksum) but only one is different. Don't know if browserify has any guarantees for this kind of cross-platform consistency, but it might be an issue worth looking into.\r\n\r\nBelow is a minimal POC that I've found by constantly trying. My project relies on echarts@^4.2.1, and uses gulp to run browserify to generate the bundle and finally compress it through gulp-uglify. In most cases this process will produce the same files on different platforms (at least in my current project).\r\n\r\n[browserify-gulp-example.zip](https://github.com/browserify/browserify/files/8331497/browserify-gulp-example.zip)\r\n\r\nThe output is the same on Ubuntu and macOS, but not on Windows.

However, if I add `bundle.require('echarts/lib/component/axis/AxisView');` after line 10 of `gulpfile.js`, the output becomes consistent.\r\n\r\nBelow is the content of `gulpfile.js`. All files are available in zip archives.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst gulp = require('gulp');\r\nconst browserify = require('browserify');\r\nconst source = require('vinyl-source-stream');\r\nconst uglify = require('gulp-uglify');\r\nconst rev = require('gulp-rev');\r\n\r\nfunction buildMain() {\r\n    let bundle = browserify({\r\n        entries: './main.js',\r\n    });\r\n    // uncomment next line the output will be consistent.\r\n    // bundle.require('echarts/lib/component/axis/AxisView');\r\n    return bundle.bundle()\r\n        .pipe(source('main.js'))\r\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('./bundle'));\r\n}\r\n\r\ngulp.task('build', gulp.series(buildMain, (done) => {\r\n    return gulp.src(`./bundle/*.js`)\r\n        .pipe(uglify())\r\n        .pipe(rev())\r\n

Additionally, without this, it seems there's no way to cache (or load from a virtual file system) the package.json files `resolve` is loading when resolving dependencies.\r\n\r\nIs there something

Either way, this is significantly faster than parsing deps with acorn via detective. It also mostly removes the need for acorn all-together. The only remaining use of acorn/ast stuff that browserify does is from the use of the package 'syntax-error', which is actually an unnecessary dependency imo, and better handled via a transform. The speed increase is significant. For example, a simple three.js scene gets bundled 2x faster using this than esbuild in dev mode.

Using `readable-stream` directly leads to multiple versions in the bundle which in turn leads again to no inheritance anywhere.\r\n3. `readable-stream` has `inspect` bug here https://github.com/nodejs/readable-stream/pull/435#issuecomment-801867019 which prevents me from debugging **why** there is any difference in `Stream` prototypes...\r\n\r\nIf there is no particular reason for such behavior I can create PR(s) that fix it, but maybe I'm missing something?","closed_at":null,"comments":0,"comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify/issues/1999/comments","created_at":"2021-03-18T14:21:19Z","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify/issues/1999/events","html_url":"https://github.com/browserify/browserify/issues/1999","id":834872381,"labels":[{"color":"C40233","default":true,"description":null,"id":203859537,"name":"bug","node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMDM4NTk1Mzc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify/labels/bug"}],"labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify/issues/1999/labels{/name}","locked":false,"milestone":null,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU4MzQ4NzIzODE=","number":1999,"performed_via_github_app":null,"reactions":{"+1":0,"-1":0,"confused":0,"eyes":0,"heart":0,"hooray":0,"laugh":0,"rocket":0,"total_count":0,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify/issues/1999/reactions"},"repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify","state":"open","state_reason":null,"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify/issues/1999/timeline","title":"multiple stream versions galore","updated_at":"2021-03-25T13:19:58Z","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/browserify/browserify/issues/1999","user":{"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/805654?v=4","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkit/events{/privacy}","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkit/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkit/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkit/gists{/gist_id}","gravatar_id":"","html_url":"https://github.com/pkit","id":805654,"login":"pkit","node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgwNTY1NA==","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkit/orgs","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkit/received_events","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkit/repos","site_admin":false,"starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkit/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkit/subscriptions","type":"User","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pkit"}}]
